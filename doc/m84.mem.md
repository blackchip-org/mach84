# `m84.mem([spec])`

Memory management unit.

This doesn't do any "memory mangement" at the moment but can be extended at a later time to support banking. It does provide convenience functions for loading and storing values to memory.


#### Arguments
- `spec.array`: Use this backing array of bytes for the memory store instead of creating an empty array.

## Functions

### `loadb(address)`

Returns a byte from the memory location at `address`

### `loadb_zp(address)`

Returns a byte from the zero-page memory location at `address`. Normally, this is the same as `loadb(address)`, but if the memory debugger is used, an exception is thrown if the `address` is not within the zero page.

### `storeb(address, value)`

Stores the byte `value` to the memory location at `address`
